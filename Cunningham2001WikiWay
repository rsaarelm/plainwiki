Bibtex is pretty good at ignoring everything outside its own markup blocks, so
you might be able to get away with pasting bibtex notes all over your wiki and
then just doing

  $ cat ~/wikilike/* > references.bib

whenever you need to latex up something.

(And of course these files should have notes about the actual work being
referenced, not general stuff about how to use a wiki bibliography.)
