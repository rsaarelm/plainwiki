Wikilike: A wiki with zero dedicated software

If you live in a text editor, why would you use a wiki that requires a web
browser to see if the markup renders correctly? With wikilike, the plaintext
file is how the page is supposed to look like, and clickable hyperlinks are
the only fancy formatting you get.

Want revision history? Version your wikilike in Git.

Want collaborative editing? Give multiple people shell accounts on the machine
that hosts the wiki files and access to the folder, if you can trust them. Or
use git pull requests.

Need even fancier stuff? See UseCases

And if you host your wiki in a directory a webserver can get into, the
BrowserViewer in index.html will magically create a web view of your wiki.

Wikilike works as is as github pages, so the only branch needed is the
gh-pages one.

If you're viewing this from the HTML view, the wikilike repository is at
https://github.com/rsaarelm/wikilike.
