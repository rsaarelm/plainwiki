Wikilike: A plaintext wiki and a static web site

You live in your text editor, so why would you use a wiki that requires a web
browser to see if the markup renders correctly? With wikilike, the plaintext
file in your editor is how the page is supposed to look like.

The initial idea of wikilike is that as long as your text editor has commands
to open the file named under the cursor and to return to the previously opened
file, you have a wiki system right there. All you need is a convention to use
camel case wiki words as your links and make all your text files have
corresponding wiki word names and no extensions, like ReadMe.

Want revision history? Version your wikilike in Git.

Want collaborative editing? Give multiple people shell accounts on the machine
that hosts the wiki files. Or use git pull requests.

Need even fancier stuff? See UseCases.

And if you host your wiki in a directory a webserver can get into, the
BrowserViewer in index.html will magically create a web view of your wiki. For
example, you can put a wikilike at your Github gh-pages branch and it will
just work.

See VimSetup on how to configure Vim to work with wikilike.

If you're reading this from a web browser, you can go to
https://github.com/rsaarelm/wikilike and grab your own copy of wikilike to use
on your machine.
