Wikilike: A wiki with zero dedicated software

If you live in a text editor, why would you use a wiki that requires a web
browser to see if the markup renders correctly? With wikilike, the plaintext
file is how the page is supposed to look like, and clickable hyperlinks are
the only fancy formatting you get.

Want revision history? Version your wikilike in Git.

Want collaborative editing? Give multiple people shell accounts on the machine
that hosts the wiki files and access to the folder, if you trust them. Or use
git pull requests.

Need even fancier stuff? See UseCases

And if you host your wiki in a directory a webserver can get into, the
BrowserViewer in index.html will magically create a web view of your wiki. For
example, you can put a wikilike at your Github gh-pages branch and it will
just work.

See VimSetup on how to configure Vim to work with wikilike.

If you're viewing this from the HTML view, the wikilike repository is at
https://github.com/rsaarelm/wikilike.
