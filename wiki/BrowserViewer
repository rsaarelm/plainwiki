The browser viewer is a javascript page that renders the wiki pages. No
backend logic is needed, just an accessible directory where the script can
load the wiki pages from. It even works on a local machine if you allow your
browser to load non-http resources from javascript, eg. by starting chromium
with --allow-file-access-from-files.
