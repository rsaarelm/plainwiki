THIS THING DOESN'T EXIST YET, but when it does, it'll convert the wiki pages
into HTML.

Since plaintext is the primary representation of plain wiki content, the
exporter can't really use something like Markdown. Instead, it'll need to
export things pretty much how they appear in a text editor, all monospaced and
with every linebreak as is.

The main extra thing needed are clickable hyperlinks. Actual urls need to be
converted into clickable ones, and the camel case wiki words need to be
converted into clickable relative links.

Also, if there's a markdown-style image link, `![alt txt](image_file.png)` and
it's the only thing on a line, it should be turned into an inline image.

Maybe this can be made into a Jekyll plugin.
