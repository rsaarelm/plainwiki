Wiki words are set up to accept numbers as well, so you can write author -
publishing year - title words style bibliography entries in your wiki, eg.
Cunningham01WikiWay.

Bibtex is pretty good at ignoring everything outside its own markup blocks, so
you might be able to get away with pasting bibtex notes all over your wiki and
then just doing

    $ cat ~/wikilike/* > references.bib

whenever you need to latex up something.

# <style>body{white-space:pre;font-family:monospace}</style>
# <script src="wikilike.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
