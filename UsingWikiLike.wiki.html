UsingWikiLike

Use WikiWord-s to refer to concepts. A WikiWord alone on a line is a title. A
page that has multiple titles (like this one) is a MultiArticlePage.

WritingWikiLike

You can't write new pages from the browser, but you live in your text editor
anyway, so why would you want to? Just go to the web server and write the
files in Vim.

The wikilike repository contains Vim syntax files for wikilike files that can
be named *.wiki or *.wiki.html. (You want the .html suffix to have the web
server think the files should have the `text/html` MIME type.)

You get version history by versioning your wiki in git. You can have
collaborative editing by giving other people Git commit access.

Plain WikiWord links will be file-local on a MultiArticlePage and will point
to a file of the WikiWord's name on a single article page. A WikiWord in
brackets, eg. [UseCases] will always point out of file. You can also point to
a specific article in an external MultiArticlePage: [UseCases#AsciiArt].

If you want to write inline code and not have it interpreted as WikiWord-s,
use backticks: `CamelCase`. For longer escaped texts, indent with at least
four spaces:

WikiLikeVimMode

Write plaintext notes. Remember to add WikiLikeBoilerplate to new pages. Press
`gd` to follow page-local links. Press `gf` to follow out-of-page links. Press
`gx` to open hyperlinks.

WikiWord

WikiWord-s designate concepts. They are made of two or more `CamelCased`
words. There's no other way of designating a WikiWord. This is the
http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiWord original way of the wiki.

The preferred way to pluralize a WikiWord is to use a hyphen separator,
WikiWord -> WikiWord-s.

WikiLikeBoilerplate

Write

    # &lt;style&gt;body{white-space:pre;font-family:monospace}&lt;/style&gt;
    # &lt;script src="wikilike.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

to the bottom of every wikilike page. This makes the page load the wikilike
conversion script when loaded in the browser. The technique has been
shamelessly copied from https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/

MultiArticlePage

Most personal wikis end up a loose collection of stub articles. Going with the
public wiki pattern of having each topic be a separate page, the stubs will
be forgotten in the filesystem. There's often much less friction in just
throwing a bunch of related items into a single file. So wikilike supports
doing that, just have more than one WikiWord alone on the line to mark a page
as a MultiArticlePage.
